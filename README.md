# CP372-TPPS
This projest was created for studying about data analytics and business intelligence

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the "Customer Shopping Trends Dataset" from Kaggle to understand customer purchasing behaviors and trends.  The primary objective is to prepare and enrich this dataset through a comprehensive process of data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering. 



The initial phase, detailed in the CP372_FinalProject_115_122.ipynb notebook, involves:

Importing and inspecting the raw dataset.
Handling any missing or duplicate data to ensure data quality.
Engineering new, insightful features to enhance analytical value, including:
Age Group
Price Category
Discount Flag (Has Discount)
Profit Margin (30% of purchase amount)
Loyalty Score (based on previous purchases and subscription status)
Average Spending per customer
The outcome of this data preparation phase is a cleaned and feature-enriched dataset (shopping_trends_feature_engineered.csv). This refined dataset is designed to be readily usable for subsequent in-depth exploratory data analysis, data visualization (e.g., using Tableau as outlined in the project canvas), and to serve as a solid foundation for potential machine learning modeling tasks.  Ultimately, the insights derived from analyzing this prepared data aim to help businesses make more informed decisions, tailor marketing strategies, and identify key customer segments and purchasing patterns.
